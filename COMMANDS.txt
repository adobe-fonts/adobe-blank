# Command lines for building Adobe Blank
#
# Version 2015-04-09
#
# The following AFDKO "makeotf" command line builds the OpenType/CFF
# font:

makeotf -f cidfont.ps -ff features -fi cidfontinfo -mf FontMenuNameDB -r -stubCmap4 -ch UnicodeAll-UTF32-H

# Note that the "-stubCmap4" command-line option was just added to the
# "makeotf" tool, and will be available in the next release of AFDKO.

# Note that the 'VORG', 'vhea', and 'vmtx' table can be safely purged,
# and to add the "stub" 'DSIG' table to the OpenType/CFF font, the
# following AFDKO command lines are used:

sfntedit -d VORG,vhea,vmtx AdobeBlank.otf
sfntedit -a DSIG=../DSIG.bin AdobeBlank.otf
sfntedit -f AdobeBlank.otf
